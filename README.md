# Some scripts to handle Matomo DB

## Usecase:  

I need to run continues integration tests with prod like DB structure.
I'm not the only one tampering with the installation. So fixtures are no good for me. I need to know what is broken when something changes. But I don't want to run all tests against a huge database. So I dump what I need to create a prod like scenario.

Will it matter? IDK, time will tell...  
Will I learn something? Most Def!

## Get Prod DB

For PROD env, run a cronjob that executes `dump-ci-raw.sh` nightly.

## Then prep the DB for CI

I could, if I want, run the prep on the prod server. But because of reasons, I do it in a separate controlled environment, with no access from the Internetz.

Run `prep-ci-db.sh` to prep the DB.

## Whattabout all the other crap

    ├── fetch-dump.sh           Just a reminder for how to get stuff with Minio.
    ├── ignore-tables.sh        E.g ignore blobs to meassure how long it takes to restore. Not used anymore.    
    ├── import_ci_dump.sh       Some things are really easy, but hard to remember.
    └── prep-ci-db.sh           The reason why I created this repo from the first place, takes for ever to do this stuff manually!
